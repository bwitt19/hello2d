Messing around in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) (the Lua framework) and getting my feet wet.  

Love2D v11.3 is required to run this code on your machine.

Going to keep this readme as a sort of personal running scratch pad of my thoughts as I keep learning more and more. I might also branch out different projects in this repo and let them exist on their own.

Nobody told me that Hollow Knight and various other amazing games were made in Unity. I already know some 3D Unity, so it just makes sense to flip to that. Saving my Lua work as a different branch in here.

So I wanted to actually learn some game engine code, after a particularly unfulfilling day at work today. I figure I'd like to use my artistic chops in a way that melds with my software engineering background, so I chose this as a little pet project. Hopefully it serves as a nice breath of fresh air after work, and serves to be a nice quarantine hobby while we're all still inside.  

I was between Unity and UE4 (I have a little experience in the former, and I feel those skills translate easily enough to the latter) when I remembered that Love existed, and that I learned about Lua for a half second while back in university. I figured it was better to build 2D games using a 2D engine first, plus it'd be nice to actually get a feel for 2D development since I know a little 3D already. Of course, I'm focusing on 2D because that's certainly less daunting than 3D development, mostly because I don't know any 3D modeling as of now, and I'm plenty proficient drawing in 2D. So Love2D, baby.  

Starting out with a simple little hello world type of thing, and having a "sprite" of Schnitzel (the one and only lmao) bounce like a DVD menu. I'd call it a fun first project to learn the ins and outs of Love development. Turns out they have stellar documentation. Always a plus in my book. So yeah! Hopefully all these entries won't be as wordy, but here's to a start. (watch this be the only update I post lol. if so, it was a fun one-shot!)
